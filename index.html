      <h3>Anson Lam</h3>
      <p>
        Since 2020, I have been an undergraduate student at City, University of London.
      </p>
       
      <p>
        Currently, I am acquiring fundamental computer science knowledge, particularly programming skills. During the 2-week Coding Bootcamp, 
        I learnt various Java coding techniques, such as methods (or functions), loops, also classes and objects. In addition to Java, 
        I have been capable of programming in Python as well.

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: E-Blind</h3>
    <p>
	This is my Processing project of the 2-week Coding Bootcamp at City, E-Blind. It demonstrates my understanding of some programming skills, including 
	users' interaction, loops, and conditionals. On the background of a beautiful view, I created a digital blind, which is made of a number of 
	regular rectangles. In fact, the E-Blind can be easily used. When you intend to block the light outside the "window", or simply want more privacy, 
	click anywhere to reduce the tranparency of the built-in digital blind gradually. Missing the beautiful view? Just press the space bar to increase 
	the level of transparency. Stay tuned for more features, from selecting your own colour of the E-Blind anytime to addition visual effects while changing 
	the transparency.
