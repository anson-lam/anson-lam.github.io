      <h3>Anson Lam</h3>
      <p>
        Since 2020, I have been an undergraduate student at City, University of London, where I am expected to receive MSci Data Science.
      </p>
       
      <p>
        Currently, I am acquiring fundamental computer science knowledge, particularly programming skills. During the 2-week Coding Bootcamp, 
        I learnt various Java coding techniques, such as methods (or functions), loops, also classes and objects. In addition to Java, 
        I have been capable of programming in Python as well.

    <h3>Uundergraduate Year 1 Programming Bootcamp, 2020: E-Blind</h3>
    <p>
  This is my Processing project of the 2-week Coding Bootcamp at City, E-Blind. It demonstrates my understanding of some programming skills, including 
  users' interaction, loops, and conditions. On the background of a beautiful view, I created a digital blind, which is made of a number of 
  regular rectangles. In fact, the E-Blind can be easily used. When you intend to block the light outside the "window", or simply want more privacy, 
  click anywhere to reduce the tranparency of the built-in digital blind gradually. Missing the beautiful view? Just press the space bar to increase 
  the level of transparency. Stay tuned for more features, from selecting your own colour of the E-Blind anytime to addition visual effects while changing 
  the transparency.

    <h3>Uundergraduate Year 1 Programming in Java Project, 2021: Get Rid of the Virus</h3>
    <p>
  This game, Get Rid of the Virus, is the project of a first year module, Programming in Java, at City. It has consolidated my basic programming skills, including conditions and loops. I, moreover, have learnt many more while developing the game, from inheritance to encapsulation, from polymorphism to graphical user interface, from timers to exceptions. However, I undeniably encountered challenges and had rooms for improvement. For instance, I found that making changes to codes while maintaining other functionalities is not easy. On account of this, I, much to my regret, did not dare to further develop my game into a more complex one. Fortunately, the final game works properly to provide some entertainment. For more details of the game, feel freee to watch the demostration video here!

    <h3>Uundergraduate Year 1 Database and Web Development Coursework, 2021: Database-driven Website</h3>
    <p>
  This database-driven website of a fictitious company, FlyUK, is the coursework of a first year module, Database and Web Development, at City. In this website, I have used a wide range of programming languages, including SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. The website link is below and browsing it yourself is the best way to know more about it!
